TESTING CODE:

Scrapes quotes and authors from http://quotes.toscrape.com/ using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

Selenium automates browser actions and can interact with dynamic web pages.

BeautifulSoup is used for parsing and extracting data from static HTML content.

Prints each quote along with its author to the console.

# 1. Start Selenium

# 3. Get page source and parse with BeautifulSoup
