## 📖 About the Project  

Free text is now data thanks to AI.  

This project explores **AI-based web-scraping methods** and their advantages over traditional approaches. The goal is to design and refine prompts that extract:  

- 🏭 Supplier capacity  
- 📜 Certifications  
- ⚠️ Supply chain risk factors  

...from unstructured web content.  

The system implements an **agentic pipeline** that automates the entire **collection → analysis → structuring** workflow, resulting in a working prototype suitable for research, industry testing, or deployment.  

As an open-source initiative, this project demonstrates how modern AI tools can transform unstructured supply chain information into actionable insights, strengthening visibility and resilience across the defense industrial base.
